PubCaseFinder: A Case-Report-Based, Phenotype-Driven Differential-Diagnosis System for Rare Diseases

We focus on case reports because these are an important tool for quickly expanding the growing body of clinical knowledge on rare diseases

and case reports often deal with previously undescribed and atypical phenotypes

We used PubMed E-utilities to obtain a large collection of case reports

A previous study has shown that PubMed includes many case reports that are not explicitly tagged as such.

HPO, initially published in 2008, has been curated by domain experts to provide a standardized vocabulary for describing phenotypic abnormalities that are widely seen in human genetic diseases.

Others have proposed various approaches, such as the co-occurrence approach, rule-based approach, and machine-learning approach, to extract relations such as protein-protein interactions and disease-gene associations from biomedical text.

In a previous study, Tudor et al.40 also tried to extract DPAs for common diseases from papers in PubMed, and they suggested ignoring low frequency occurrences to filter out potentially noisy DPAs.
